Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone who looked at her but most of all by her grandmother and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child Once she gave her a little riding hood of red velvet which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else so she was always called Little Red Riding Hood One day her mother said to her Come Little Red Riding Hood here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine take them to your grandmother she is ill and weak and they will do her good Set out before it gets hot and when you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother will get nothing and when you go into her room dont forget to say Good morning and dont peep into every corner before you do it I will take great care said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother and gave her hand on it The grandmother lived out in the wood half a league from the village and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood a wolf met her Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid of him Good day Little Red Riding Hood said he Thank you kindly wolf Whither away so early Little Red Riding Hood To my grandmothers What have you got in your apron Cake and wine yesterday was baking day so poor sick grandmother is to have something good to make her stronger Where does your grandmother live Little Red Riding Hood A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood her house stands under the three large oak trees the nut trees are just below you surely must know it replied Little Red Riding Hood
